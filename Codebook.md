#### Accelerometer Data #####

The R script will generate two data sets. The first, tidy.txt, gives the means and standard deviations of each measurement for each subject. The second, means_by_subject_and_activity.txt, gives the mean measurement of each variable sorted by subject and activity. 

#### Steps ####

1. Set working directory to the directory containing the datasets - UCI HAR Dataset. 

2. Run run_analysis.R to generate the two cleaned data sets.
